What I still need to do:
  -for the input, when the user types more than a certain amount, have the words start on a new line to avoid it being hidden by the emoji's.
  -on the like and reply, the hover text should be emojis
  -If I like the status, the number of likes should increase and my name should appear in the likes hover, and I should only be able to do it once
  -If I click "comment", it should focus on input
  -If I click share, a dropdown menu should appear
  -If I hover over a user's avatar photo, their cover photo and information should be displayed
  -When clicking the friends icon, a dropdown menu should appear with a "more" section
  -Three dots at the top right should show a dropdown when clicked and not hovered over
-Add hover messages to the emojis in the input
-Under the comments hover show the names of people who commented
-on comments click, hide the comments and input
-add a timer that counts how many minutes/hours/days/weeks you made the comment or post
-if you hit reply, your comment gets posted under theirs
-onclick actions for emojis in comment input
-make it so you can only love or like a status once
-add second dropdown to userdropdown more
